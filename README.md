# State_of_Data_Science_in_Zimbabwe
The 4th industrial revolution is upon us &amp; the advent of Data Science &amp; Big Data Analytics has already begun to shape how businesses are run &amp; key decisions are made. This statement is true in the 1st world, but how much does it resonate in Zimbabwe?  Iâ€™m currently carrying out a study that answers that question by assessing the State of Data Science in Zimbabwe. I aim to get the opinions of managers/executives who drive strategy in the private &amp; public sectors. I designed a survey to do that, so please take your time to answer the following question if it applies to you. A report on the matter will be published on my blog once the study is complete.
